## Teaching philosophy 

My teaching philosophy is to empower and humanely develop 
the next generations of diverse critical thinkers in a 
welcoming and inclusive environment. My teaching approach 
combines their gained self-efficacy and intrinsic knowledge, 
skills, abilities (KSAs) to solve engineering, human, and 
global problems. I have the following three measurable strategies.

   * Setting a clear course structure with specific and measurable 
     learning objectives and expectations of the student-educator roles and responsibilities
   * Using teaching methods centered around inquiry-based teaching and course enjoyment
   * Evaluating and reflecting on the students' gained KSAs and self-efficacy to improve

This approach forms an intentional virtuous (feedback-loop) 
cycle for continuous growth of student outcomes and my teaching. 

My learning objectives align with Blooms Taxonomy of 
education objectives. That is, by the end my lectures and/or 
recitations, students shall be able to 
   * identify the fundamental principle(s) involved in
    a problem (remember and understand),
   * systematic approach to solving fluids/engineering 
    problems (apply and analyze), and
   * reflect on the KSAs gained to build their 
    self-efficacy (evaluate and create).
