  <h4>Bubble and droplet dynamics</h4>
The fluid dynamics associated with cavitating bubbles and impinging droplets can ablate cancer cells (oncotripsy), fragment tissues (miniscalpels), and deliver drugs, among many other functions.
I develop high-fidelity computational methods to simulate these flows, accelerating the development of acoustics-driven therapies.
This includes multiple state-of-the-art methods for bubbly flow dynamics, which created <a href="https://bryngelson-research.com/papers/bryngelson-IJMF-19.pdf" target="_blank">guidelines for model selection</a>.
I then improved these models via a <a href="https://bryngelson-research.com/papers/bryngelson-IJMF-20.pdf" target="_blank">statistical approach that uses neural networks</a>.
This enables realistic simulations of the large bubble populations that nucleate near soft tissues during treatment.
In particular, such methods were implemented in an open-source solver we developed, <a href="https://bryngelson-research.com/papers/bryngelson-CPC-19.pdf" target="_blank">MFC</a>.
These simulations have already improved *burst-wave lithotripsy administration in human trials*.
I have also applied this method to other <a href="https://bryngelson-research.com/papers/bryngelson-JCP-20.pdf" target="_blank">bubble cavitation problems</a> of great societal impact.
For example, quantifying the potential for <a href="https://bryngelson-research.com/papers/bryngelson-JFM-19.pdf" target="_blank">cavitation-induced erosion of rough materials</a>, an important consideration for targeted treatment of urinary stones.
