#### `research strategy`

My research strategy is to numerically compute flow physics to 
understand, model, and manipulate flows. By advancing numerical 
techniques with high-order accurate, interface-capturing Eulerian 
(flow-focused) methods, we can reliably understand these flows. 
The intention of such computations is two-fold. First, simplified-physics 
models are developed from these simulations to predict the flow behavior. 
These models are then used in computations simulating experiments or 
operating conditions. Second, quantify the uncertainty in both the 
simulations and experiments. This cycle continues and converging towards 
flow control.
