## Service

I educate and mentor ethical, world-leading engineers and scholars for the 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. 
I am resolved to make my life's work a bridge for historically 
underrepresented students and communities towards 
socio-economic uplift through STEM education. My approach 
consists of a virtuous cycle of service activities to 
produce world-leading scholars. The approach is as follows: 

  * Provide high-quality research opportunities and mentorship for underrepresented students
  * Implement an inclusive growth-mindset-oriented teaching approach
  * Proactively partake in STEM access outreach activities for an 
    inclusive department climate

I demonstrated my service record through my leadership and innovation with the 
<a href="https://shpe.org/" target="_blank">Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers</a> 
(SHPE), a national STEM-diversity organization founded in 1974.

<h4>National Chapter Program</h4>
The National Chapter Program provides a chapter management, alignment compliance,
and growth framework for SHPE chapters to realize the SHPE Mission and Vision through
their events and functions that lead to increased member participation and success.
The program focuses on targeting chapter management and growth through a STEM 
workforce-preparedness pedagogical framework. The framework encompasses a cycle 
for continuous development and membership growth of the chapters towards measurable 
mission fulfillment. I have been the program developer and manager for the last 
decade.

<h4>National Institute for Leadership Advancement (NILA)</h4>
NILA is the premier leadership conference provided by 
SHPE to the Hispanic STEM community. It is a three-day 
conference in the first week of August. SHPE chapters send one of 
their elected representatives to NILA, typically the chapter president, 
to be developed into a leader. As a result, the chapter leaders 
are equipped to lead their chapter leadership and members toward a 
successful post-graduation transition into the STEM workforce (students) and 
career upward-mobility and positive impact within the Hispanic 
community (professionals). For the last ten years, I have furthered the 
development of leadership NILA curriculum. 

* I applied a socio-cognitive model <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/plata-conecd-20.pdf" target="_blank">to the SHPE and NILA leadership framework</a>
to measure the leadership self-efficacy of Hispanic students and <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/papers/rodriguez-conecd-20.pdf" target="_blank">professionals</a> as a result of the NILA experience
