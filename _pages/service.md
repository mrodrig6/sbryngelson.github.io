## Service

I plan educate 
and mentor ethical, world-leading engineers and scholars for the 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. 
I am resolved to make my life's work a bridge for historically 
underrepresented students and communities towards 
socio-economic uplift through STEM education.  

  * Provide high-quality research opportunities and mentorship for underrepresented students
  * Implement an inclusive growth-mindset-oriented teaching approach
  * Proactively partake in STEM access outreach activities for an 
    inclusive department climate
