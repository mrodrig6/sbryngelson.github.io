  abstract: "The destructive growth and collapse of cavitation bubbles are used for therapeutic purposes in focused ultrasound procedures and can contribute to tissue damage in traumatic injuries. Histotripsy is a focused ultrasound procedure that relies on controlled cavitation to homogenize soft tissue. Experimental studies of histotripsy cavitation have shown that the extent of ablation in different tissues depends on tissue mechanical properties and waveform parameters. Variable tissue susceptibility to the large stresses, strains, and strain rates developed by cavitation bubbles has been suggested as a basis for localized liver tumor treatments that spare large vessels and bile ducts. However, field quantities developed within microns of cavitation bubbles are too localized and transient to measure in experiments. Previous numerical studies have attempted to circumvent this challenge but made limited use of realistic tissue property data. In this study, numerical simulations are used to calculate stress, strain, and strain rate fields produced by bubble oscillation under histotripsy forcing in a variety of tissues with literature-sourced viscoelastic and acoustic properties. Strain field calculations are then used to predict a theoretical damage radius using tissue ultimate strain data. Simulation results support the hypothesis that differential tissue responses could be used to design tissue-selective treatments. Results agree with studies correlating tissue ultimate fractional strain with resistance to histotripsy ablation and are also consistent with experiments demonstrating smaller lesion size under exposure to higher frequency waveforms. Methods presented in this study provide an approach for modeling tissue-selective cavitation damage in general."

  abstract: "Experimental observations of the growth and collapse of acoustically and laser-nucleated single bubbles in water and agarose gels of varying stiffness are presented. The maximum radii of generated bubbles decreased as the stiffness of the media increased for both nucleation modalities, but the maximum radii of laser-nucleated bubbles decreased more rapidly than acoustically nucleated bubbles as the gel stiffness increased. For water and low stiffness gels, the collapse times were well predicted by a Rayleigh cavity, but bubbles collapsed faster than predicted in the higher stiffness gels. The growth and collapse phases occurred symmetrically (in time) about the maximum radius in water but not in gels, where the duration of the growth phase decreased more than the collapse phase as gel stiffness increased. Numerical simulations of the bubble dynamics in viscoelastic media showed varying degrees of success in accurately predicting the observations."

  abstract: "An Eulerian approach for simulations of wave propagation in multiphase, viscoelastic media is developed in the context of the Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSM). We extend the AUSM scheme to the five-equation model for simulations of interfaces between gases, liquids, and solids with constitutive relations appropriately transported. In this framework, the solid's deformations are assumed to be infinitesimally small such that they can be modeled using linear viscoelastic models, e.g., generalized Zener. The Eulerian framework addresses the challenge of calculating strains, more naturally expressed in a Lagrangian framework, by using a hypoelastic model that takes an objective Lie derivative of the constitutive relation to transform strains into velocity gradients. Our approach introduces elastic stresses in the convective fluxes that are treated by generalizing AUSM flux-vector splitting (FVS) to account for the Cauchy stress tensor. We determine an appropriate discretization of non-conservative equations that appear in the five-equation multiphase model with AUSM schemes to prevent spurious oscillations at material interfaces. The framework's spatial scheme is solution-adaptive with a discontinuity sensor discriminating between smooth and discontinuous regions. The smooth regions are computed using explicit high-order central differences. At discontinuities regions (i.e., shocks, material interfaces and contacts), the convective fluxes are treated using a high-order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme with AUSM$^+$-up for upwinding. The framework is used to simulate 1D and 2D problems that demonstrate the ability to maintain equilibrium interfacial conditions and solve challenging multi-dimensional and multi-material problems."

  abstract: "A novel Eulerian approach is proposed for numerical simulations of wave propagation in viscoelastic media, for application to shocks interacting with interfaces between fluids and solids. We extend the five-equations multiphase interface-capturing model, based on the idea that all the materials (gases, liquids, solids) obey the same equation of state with spatially varying properties, to incorporate the desired constitutive relation; in this context, interfaces are represented by discontinuities in material properties. We consider problems in which the deformations are small, such that the substances can be described by linear constitutive relations, specifically, Maxwell, Kelvinâ€“Voigt or generalized Zener models. The main challenge lies in representing the combination of viscoelastic, multiphase and compressible flow. One particular difficulty is the calculation of strains in an Eulerian framework, which we address by using a conventional hypoelastic model in which an objective time derivative (Lie derivative) of the constitutive relation is taken to evolve strain rates instead. The resulting eigensystem is analyzed to identify wave speeds and characteristic variables. The spatial scheme is based on a solution-adaptive formulation, in which a discontinuity sensor discriminates between smooth and discontinuous regions. To compute the convective fluxes, explicit high-order central differences are applied in smooth regions, while a high-order finite-difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme is used at discontinuities (shocks, material interfaces and contacts). The numerical method is verified in a comprehensive fashion using a series of smooth and discontinuous (shocks and interfaces), one- and two-dimensional test problems."

  abstract: "We investigate the sedimentation of a sphere in a viscoelastic fluid with a cross-shear flow by numerical simulation. The non-Newtonian properties of the suspending fluid determine the settling rate of the sphere. Experiments [Tonmukayakul et al., US Patent Number US8,024,962(B2) (2010); van den Brule and Gheissary, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 49 (1993) 123-132] have shown the settling rate increases with increase in cross-shear Weissenberg number, Wi, in elastic guar gum solutions and decreases in Boger fluids. In the present work, simulations of a sheared viscoelastic flow past a sphere are used to study the effect of the shear-thinning and elasticity of the carrying fluid on the sphere's settling rate. The elastic guar gum solutions are modeled using the Giesekus constitutive model. The parameters are obtained by fitting the rheological data. The drag on the sphere decreases, i.e. the settling rate increases, with an increase in the shear Weissenberg number that is in qualitative agreement with the experiments. The decrease in the drag is primarily due to the decrease in the polymer drag component because of shear-thinning. This is in contrast with the increase in the drag in Boger fluids due to the increase in viscous drag. The effect of different polymer characteristics such as shear thinning and elasticity on the flow field is presented. There is an optimum value for the amount of polymers in the solution for the increase in the viscous drag to overcome the decrease in the polymer drag leading to a net increase in the drag on the sphere. The effect of walls on the drag coefficients in Boger fluids is also investigated. It is demonstrated that the effect of the increase in the drag coefficients with Wi is accentuated as the interaction with the wall grows stronger. The wall interactions lead to an increase in viscous shear stresses downstream of the sphere, which causes the increase in the drag."
